I, Rick Van Rousselt, operate the SPAdminBot website(https://spadminbot.azurewebsites.net) and the SPAdminBot bot in Skype, DirectLine, Webchat and Microsoft Teams. This page informs you of my policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information I receive when you use my services. I use your Personal Information only for providing and improving the site and the chatbot. By using my services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

#Information Collection And Use

While using my services, I may ask you to provide me with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to your name and email ("Personal Information").

#Log Data

Like many site operators, my service collects information that your system sends whenever you visit my service ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of my service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics.

#Cookies

Cookies are files with small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer's hard drive. Like many sites, I use "cookies" to collect information. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of my service.

#Security

The security of your Personal Information is important to me, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

#Bot Framework

My chatbot is enabled by Microsofts Bot Framework. Bot Framework is a set of web-services that enable intelligent services and connections using conversation channels you authorize. As a service provider, Microsoft will create a Bot Framework user profile and receive content you provide to my bot/service in order to enable the service and to help improve Microsoft services. For more information about Microsoft privacy policies please see their privacy statement here: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839. To report abuse when using a bot that uses Bot Framework to Microsoft, please visit the Microsoft Bot Framework website at https://www.botframework.com and use the Report Abuse link in the menu to contact Microsoft.
